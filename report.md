## Evidence of the Work that You Completed for this Assignment

Please provide and necessary further evidence of the work that you completed as
part of this laboratory assignment. You may include links to the work that you
finished on GitHub. Please also note that:

* Copying over the `conduct.md` file is the way in which you show that you
  adhered to the code of conduct during this week of the project.

* After copying over the `assessment.md` file either from either the previous
  week's repository or from the main repository, you should evaluate yourself
  according to all relevant criteria. The instructor will assume that your
  evaluation level is "N" if you have not yet completed work for a category.
  Once you assess yourself for a specific professional or technical skill, you
  should furnish evidence that supports your current assessment. As you continue
  to work on the software project, you can adjust your assessment and add more
  evidence. Please see the course instructor with assessment questions.
